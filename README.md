# Calculator (Week 4 Exercise)
## Object-Oriented Programming

### Background
The purpose of this repository is to complete one of my exercises for Week 4 of my training focussed on OOP.

In this example I was given the below `Calculator` class and asked to "Refactor the methods in the Calculator example into two classes as you see fit."xs

```
class Calculator
  def add(number_1, number_2)
    number_1 + number_2
  end

  def subtract(number_1, number_2)
    number_1 - number_2
  end

  def print_answer(answer)
    "The Answer is: #{ answer }"
  end
end
```
